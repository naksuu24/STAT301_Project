# Quick Start Guide

Get started with the AirBnB data analysis in just a few steps!

## Prerequisites

Choose your preferred analysis environment:

### Option A: Python
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option B: R
```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "knitr", "kableExtra", "rmarkdown"))
```

---

## Running the Analysis

### Python (Recommended for Quick Results)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/STAT301_Project

# Run the analysis
python scripts/analyze_airbnb.py
```

**Output:**
- Console output with statistics and test results
- 4 PNG visualizations in `figures/` directory

### R

```r
# Set working directory
setwd("/path/to/STAT301_Project")

# Run the analysis
source("scripts/analyze_airbnb.R")
```

**Output:**
- Console output with statistics and test results
- 4 PNG visualizations in `figures/` directory

---

## Generating the Full Report

### R Markdown Report (Most Comprehensive)

```r
library(rmarkdown)
rmarkdown::render("reports/airbnb_analysis_report.Rmd")
```

This creates an HTML report with:
- Embedded code
- Interactive tables
- All visualizations
- Statistical test results
- Professional formatting

The report will be saved as `reports/airbnb_analysis_report.html`

### Markdown Summary (Quick Reference)

Simply open `reports/airbnb_analysis_summary.md` in any text editor or markdown viewer for a comprehensive summary of findings.

## What You'll Get

### Visualizations (in `figures/`)

1. **price_distribution.png**
   - Histogram showing price distribution
   - Helps identify pricing patterns and outliers

2. **price_by_room_type.png**
   - Box plots comparing prices by room type
   - Shows median, quartiles, and outliers

3. **reviews_vs_price.png**
   - Scatter plot with regression line
   - Examines relationship between reviews and pricing

4. **neighbourhood_distribution.png**
   - Bar chart of top neighbourhoods
   - Identifies most popular areas

### Statistical Results

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, median, std dev, quartiles
- **ANOVA Test:** Price differences by room type
- **Correlation Analysis:** Reviews vs. price relationship
- **Distribution Analysis:** Price and review patterns

## Customizing the Analysis

### Using Your Own Data

1. **Format your data** to match the sample CSV structure:
   - Required columns: id, price, room_type, neighbourhood, number_of_reviews
   - Optional columns: all others

2. **Save your data** as `data/your_data.csv`

3. **Update the script** to use your data:
   
   **Python:**
   ```python
   df = load_data('data/your_data.csv')
   ```
   
   **R:**
   ```r
   airbnb_data <- read_csv("data/your_data.csv")
   ```

### Modifying Visualizations

Edit the scripts to customize:
- Colors and themes
- Figure dimensions
- Statistical tests
- Additional analyses
